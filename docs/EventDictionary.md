# User Event Dictionary

This document provides a comprehensive dictionary of all user events tracked on the OZListings.com platform. It serves as a reference for understanding what actions users are taking and what data is being collected for analytics and product improvement purposes.

## Event Tracking Schema

User events are tracked using the `trackUserEvent(eventType, metadata)` function.

-   `eventType` (string): A unique identifier for the event being tracked.
-   `metadata` (object): An optional object containing additional data relevant to the event. The current URL path is automatically included in the metadata for every event.

Events are stored in the `user_events` table in our Supabase database, which has the following key columns:
-   `user_id`: The ID of the logged-in user. Events are only tracked for authenticated users.
-   `event_type`: The name of the event.
-   `metadata`: A JSON object containing event-specific data.
-   `endpoint`: The URL path where the event occurred.
