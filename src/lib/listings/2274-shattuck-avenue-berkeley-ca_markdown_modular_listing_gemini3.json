The project is designed for 227 units and 780 private beds, targeting the extreme housing shortfall currently facing the university. Developed via a Qualified Opportunity Zone Business (QOZB) structure, the project is uniquely positioned to offer investors substantial tax-efficient growth potential.",

The sponsorship team brings deep local expertise, having previously operated as the largest private student landlord at UC Berkeley prior to a landmark portfolio sale. Groundbreaking is targeted for Q2 2027 with pricing already secured from reputable contractors."

The firm has a deep historical footprint in the Berkeley and San Francisco markets, specializing in dense, mixed-use, infill developments. From 2004 to 2007, Panoramic was the largest private landlord for UC Berkeley students, managing a portfolio that was ultimately sold to Equity Residential in 2007 for $146 million—the largest real estate transaction in Berkeley's history at the time.",

Currently, Panoramic is leveraging its 35 years of hyper-local expertise to develop 2274 Shattuck Avenue, a 17-story student housing project designed to address the university's chronic ~27,000-bed shortfall."
